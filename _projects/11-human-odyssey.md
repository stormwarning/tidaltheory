Child of the Ice Age tells the story of humanity's journey through time. Written by Anthropologist Niobe Thompson, this module tells us that the Ice Age, droughts, and volcanic explosions and other cataclysmic events all played a part in helping humans become the dominant species on Earth. To test further educate series watchers, the site also features a quiz, behind the scenes videos and pictures, and educational material.

Each interest point has lots of information that shows what life was like at a crucial time and place. We combined interviews, photo galleries, data and beautiful videos to make a journey that can be taken on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.
